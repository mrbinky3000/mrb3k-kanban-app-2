# mrb3k-kanban-app-2
This is just me following along with version 2.0.0-rc3 of the book "SurviveJS - Webpack and React"

You can possibly see a working version of the latest tag here:
http://mrbinky3000.github.io/mrb3k-kanban-app-2/

This is basically a playground for me messing around with react and following that book. Nothing is guarenteed to work.

## Tags
I tagged a commit almost every time the author states something along the lines of "if you run the project now..."  Each tag is stable and should run just fine.  If it doesn't run, there's most likely an issue with your dev environment (wrong version of node, PATH variables missing, stuff like that)
