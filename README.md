# mrb3k-kanban-app-2
This repository is just me following along with version 2.0.0-rc3 of the book "SurviveJS - Webpack and React" by Juho Veps채l채inen. I went through the tutorial and tagged many stable commits along the way.  Hopefully this can help others who are following the book and make mistakes that prevent a sucessful build.

You can see a working version of the app here:

## Tags
I tagged a commit almost every time the author states something along the lines of "if you run the project now..."  Each tag is stable and should run just fine.  If it doesn't run, there is most likely an issue with your local dev environment (wrong version of node, PATH variables missing, stuff like that)  Later in the book, when they discuss typecasting, you'll need to install the flow binary on your machine to get that stuff to work.

Tags 0.0.0 through 0.11.4 are straight from the book.  There are chapters after chapter 11, but they start covering hypothetical situations and sometimes just compare and contrast different methods of accomplishing something, like styling components, for example.  For all intents and purposes, the book's app building tutorial stops after 0.11.4

Any other branches besides "master", or tags higher than 0.x.x are not part of the book.  It's just me playing around with what I learned from the book and attempting to make the app "my own"

## Thoughts on The Book
I liked the book ["SurviveJS - Webpack and React" by Juho Veps채l채inen](http://survivejs.com/).  It took me about a week to get through it all.  A little over half of the book is dedicated to walking you through building a React.js Kanban app.  This includes tons of helpful information regarding setting up your development environment.  The last half deals with theory and contains helpful appendixes that I'll most like keep referring to from time to time as I build my own projects.
